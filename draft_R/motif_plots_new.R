# This should be broken down into smaller functions
# It does two things: combines data, and generates plots
# It takes data_indices_all as input, which is the data frame returned by the
# function time_series

# Function 1: complete_time_series
# This function returns the complete time series per site per month

# Function 2: plot_time_series
# This function plots the time series per site per month

# Function 3: hime_series / hime_indices
# This function combines the indices time series with the hime motif output
# This function needs to be broken down into smaller functions
